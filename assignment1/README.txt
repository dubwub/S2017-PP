Parallel Programming HW 1: CLA adder

How to use:
> gcc compiles hw1.c without any warnings/issues
> usage: ./a.out <num1> <num2> where num1, num2 are both in hex format (0-9, a-f accepted) and less than or equal to 128 digits.
> program will print <num1 + num2>

Errors:
If the program detects any characters other than those allowed or numbers that are too long, then it will exit out.

Please reach out if there are any problems/you have any questions!
